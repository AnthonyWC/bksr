# bksr - Buildkite Step Runner

[![NPM package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bksr.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bksr)

Run and test your [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) pipeline steps locally, just as they'd run in CI,
using the [buildkite-agent bootstrap](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent) itself.

```
$ bksr
? Choose a pipeline step to run (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ :shell: Shellcheck
  :sparkles: Lint
  :shell: Tests
```

Features:

* Runs any Buildkite command pipeline step, including those that use plugins
* Won‚Äôt accidentally run steps designed for branches (such as 'master' only release steps)
* Can run dynamic pipelines via STDIN
* Can run all steps in sequence, including specifying a branch for branch filtering
* Can run a fresh checkout, emulating a clean CI agent environment

## Installation

```
$ npm i -g bksr
```

Or, run it directly using [npx](https://github.com/zkat/npx):

```
$ npx bksr
```

Or, like srsly:

```
$ ln -s $(which bksr) /usr/local/bin/bksrsly
$ bksrsly
? Choose a pipeline step to run (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ :shell: Shellcheck
  :sparkles: Lint
  :shell: Tests
```

## Requirements

* [buildkite-agent](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent) v3+

## Roadmap

### Small stuff

* Fix examples not showing in `--help`
* Move build and plugin dir from `/tmp/bkrun` to `~/.bkrun`
* Check for new updated versions using [update-check](https://github.com/zeit/update-check)
* Self-contained binaries to GitHub release using [pkg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg)
* Homebrew

### Bigger stuff

* Support env var substituion in pipeline.yml ([buildkite/agent#765](buildkite/agent#765))
* Support setting env vars based on pipeline.yml
* Hide build output via header collapsing
* Local-mode artifact/metadata/pipeline commands
* Bundling the buildkite-agent binary maybe?

## Developing

You can run it locally by invoking `lib/bksr.js` from the command line:

```
$ cd ~/some-project
$ ~/path-to-bksr-checkout/bin/bksrc.js
```

To run the unit and integration tests:

```
$ docker-compose run app npm run test
$ docker-compose run app npm run bats
```

Or, you can use bksr itself üò±

```
$ bin/bksr.js --all
```

## Releasing

The following command will:

* Ensure you‚Äôre on master
* Update the version number in package.json
* Create and push the git tag
* Open GitHub releases so you can fill out release notes, and open previous
  releases so you can copy+pasta

```bash
git checkout master && git pull && npm version [major | minor | patch]
```
